# üëã Hi, I'm Shiva Kumar Kahar

I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Networking with a major in Cybersecurity** at Melbourne Institute of Technology, where I am building strong foundations in networking, system administration, and information security. Alongside my degree, I have completed the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, which has given me valuable industry-focused training in security operations, incident response, risk assessment, and network defense strategies.  

My career goal is to become a skilled **Cybersecurity Professional**, contributing to the protection of digital assets and the resilience of modern IT systems. I am particularly passionate about threat detection, penetration testing, network security, and cloud-based security solutions. I enjoy solving technical challenges and continuously seek opportunities to apply my knowledge through practical projects and labs.  

On GitHub, I showcase a variety of projects that reflect my technical skills and learning journey, including:  
- **Network Traffic Analysis** using Wireshark for HTTP, DNS, and TLS protocols.  
- **Python Security Tools**, such as a port scanner and log analyzer.  
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups**, documenting my solutions to cybersecurity challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox.  
- **Cloud Security Configurations**, where I experiment with AWS IAM policies and secure infrastructure setups.  

My technical skills include:  
- **Networking Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer, pfSense, Wireshark  
- **Cybersecurity Tools:** Splunk, Wazuh, Snort, Nmap  
- **Programming & Scripting:** Python, Bash, PowerShell  
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS and Azure security management  
- **Certifications:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate (completed), CompTIA Security+ (in progress)  

I strongly believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing. Through this GitHub profile, I aim to demonstrate not just what I have learned, but also how I apply it to real-world scenarios.
